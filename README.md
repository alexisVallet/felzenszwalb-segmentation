felzenszwalb-segmentation
=========================

C++ implementation of Felzenszwalb's segmentation algorithm, based on OpenCV and boost. See "Efficient graph-based image segmentation" by PF Felzenszwalb and DP Huttenlocher, 2004 for details about the algorithm ([link to pdf]). Designed to be able to handle high-dimensional feature spaces instead of the usual 3-channels color spaces. As of the writing of this file, the source code should be considered experimental.
